# Disaster Routing for Elastic Optical Network experiments

Current issues:

- [x] DZ edges in NSFNET or not (currently not, after discussion with my group)
- [ ] DC placement
- [x] Flow routing does not respect DZ edges (currently not, after discussion with my group)

Planned features:

- [ ] EA-based routing process
- [ ] "Local-searchy" operation after the heuristic
